This meetup is inspired by [ACX Meetups Everywhere](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/meetups-everywhere-2024-times-and) and groups like [Rationality Freiburg](http://www.rationality-freiburg.de). 

We aim to create a space where people who enjoy discussing rationalist topics can meet regularly. Whether it's articles from LessWrong or ACX, AI timelines, or other topics, we invite you to join us.

We meet on the first Wednesday of every month. Keep an eye on the **Events** page for upcoming meetups!
